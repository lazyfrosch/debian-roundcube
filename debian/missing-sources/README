Missing source files
--------------------

Roundcube ships a tar.gz ready to use that embeds minified javascript
libraries. The GPL requires you to provide the corresponding source code.

For Debian all missing sources are bundled in this directory. They have been
grabbed from the various upstream projects.

Last synchronization was made with roundcube v1.2.0 at 2016-05-25.
