roundcube (0.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Closes: #592312.
     + Drop patches included upstream (DNS prefetching, jQuery 1.4
       handling, email address validation, duplicate headers, incorrectly
       formatted received headers). Adapt other patches. One of the patch
       now correctly states to use dpkg-reconfigure roundcube-core.
       Closes: #608977.
     + Update SQL commands to use to upgrade database.
       That also closes: #602922. Unfortunately, the user may get some
       harmless error messages because there is no way to know if
       0.3.1 was installed from scratch or upgraded from 0.3.
     + Update dependencies to match INSTALL file. Only exception is the
       use of Mail_Mime 1.8.0 in place of 1.8.1 which is not available in
       Debian. We depends on jQuery 1.4.2 because 1.4.4 is not available in
       Debian.
     + All folders are correctly checked since 0.4. Closes: #552430.
     + Also, closes: #553194 since it seems to have been fixed too.
     + There is also the possibility to not top-quote since 0.4.
       Closes: #491063.
     + Closes: #602144. Also fixed.
  * Move .htaccess to /etc/roundcube and use a symlink (Closes: #591369).
  * Don't let www-data overwrite debian-db.php. Closes: #608976.
  * Bump Standards-Version. No changes required.
