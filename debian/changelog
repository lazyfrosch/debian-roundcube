roundcube (0.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #469487).
     - This release seems to fix failure to set some fields when replying,
       with bincimap as IMAP server (Closes: #443562)
     - It also fixes the deletion of multiple messages, still with
       bincimap (Closes: #451404)
  * Remove 'ob_gzhandler.patch' and 'xss-fix.patch'. They have been
    merged upstream.
  * Upstream has switched to MDB2 database backend which is not packaged
    in Debian yet. We switch back to old backend.
  * Fix debian/watch to handle correctly detection of new versions.
  * Add support for lighttpd and remove support for older version of
    Apache. The debconf question about webserver autoconfiguration is
    reworded (Closes: #462961).
  * Do not depend on a specific revision of cdbs.
  * Move po-debconf from Build-Depends-Indep to Build-Depends since it is
    needed for clean target.
  * Correct path to /usr/share/file/magic, provided by libmagic1. Provide
    license information about this file in debian/copyright.
