For better compatibility, the schema used for MySQL is the one
targeted at MySQL 4.0, not the one for MySQL 4.1 or MySQL 5.x.

To use tinymce editor:
 - set $rcmail_config['htmleditor'] to TRUE in
   /etc/roundcube/main.inc.php

No plugins are shipped (except core plugins) with this package of
roundcube. Add your plugin in /var/lib/roundcube/plugins.
