For better compatibility, the schema used for MySQL is the one
targeted at MySQL 4.0, not the one for MySQL 4.1 or MySQL 5.x.

To use tinymce editor:
 - set $rcmail_config['enable_htmleditor'] to TRUE in
   /etc/roundcube/main.inc.php

The spellchecker is disabled since it is not present in tinymce Debian
package.
