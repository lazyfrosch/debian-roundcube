Description: Update PHP pear dependecies
 The current dependencies that are published by upstream are too
 conservative.
 * So replace ~ (that only allows minor versions changes) with >= as documented
 in the INSTALL file.
 * delete dependency to net_idna2, that is only needed for PHP < 5.3
   (idn_to_utf8 and idn_to_ascii)
